# Schumann - Estrella
## v3.3
### Initial Thoughts
What needs to be done is slur shapes need to be adjusted. This will absorb most of my time in this version.

### Process
The process for this part of the challenge is much easier said than done, especially when one has a finicky mouse. My mouse is not precision technology, and it likes to jump around occasionally, so I will have to make do with this problem and my arrow buttons for adjustment.

Other things that I will have to make a decision about will be to decide whether or not I should shorten the stems of some notes (in order to reflect the plate better). This will happen case-by-case, and it will involve the `special tool pallete` to accomplish the goal.

#### Thoughts during the process
I have noticed that the engraver made heavy use of pre-defined slur-knibs in the score. For example, when the syncopated patter begins at the "Piu presto..." section, the slur shapes are all the exact same size and manner. This does not necessarily make the music easier to read (on a note by note basis) but it serves the purpose well to create a homogeneous texture. There is also an error on the end of the second line with the slur, because it ought to be facing downward. Though I'm sure it doesn't matter that much, but given that this edition is supposed to be an improvement, I cannot see why we should correct it.

Time Elapsed: 00:30:00

### Concluding Thoughts

Though it was a tedious process, I reflect on how difficult this process would be using trial and error through a text-based program. I think this process is well suited for a WYSIWYG.

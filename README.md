### Engraving Challenges

This is an open contest in music engraving, aiming to
test music notation software in controlled conditions.
You can find more information (and instructions for participants)
[here](https://github.com/engraving-challenges/main/blob/master/README.md).


Schumann's _Estrella_ from _Carnaval op. 9_
-------------------------------------------

The goal of this particular challenge is not only to test engravers
and their programs, but also the rules and workflows of the contest itself.
Therefore we have deliberately picked a fairly straightforward piece:
it is short enough to be engraved in whole and consists mostly of quite
simple notation.  However, do not underestimate it!  Submissions that
we had already received show that there are a few challenging elements
which some programs have difficulty with.  So, it should be an excellent
warm-up piece.

You can find the score in the [estrella.png](estrella.png) file.

#### Page layout details

- paper size is 24x31 cm,
- line-width is 20.5 cm, which gives ~17 mm margins (in the original
  the margins aren't symmetrical, but we don't have to replicate this -
  the important thing is to get the width of the systems the same),
- staves are about 7 mm high (~20 pt).

#### Specific challenges

Please pay particular attention to these elements, and document in detail how
you handled them:

- inconventional voicing in m.34, right hand
- invisible rests in lower voice of the left hand

**_Please make sure you read the [instructions](https://github.com/engraving-challenges/main/blob/master/2-editing-workflow.md) before starting ANY work!_**

### Engraving Challenges

This is an open contest in music engraving; it's aim is to
test music notation software in controlled conditions.

Schumann's _Estrella_ from _Carnaval op. 9_
-------------------------------------------

Since the goal of this particular challenge is not only to test engravers
and their programs, but also the rules and workflows of the contest itself,
we have deliberately picked a fairly straightforward piece.
It is short enough to be engraved in whole,
it does *not* pose real engraving difficulties but *still* has some basic challenges
built-in, such as polyphonic settings and a rather large number of articulations.

You can find the score in the [estrella.png](estrella.png) file.

As the rules and workflows aren't fully tested yet, please check back
with someone else before starting work.

Please remember: this is a challenge and only partly a contest. There is no deadline.
The point is to try creating the most beautiful engraving with notation package of your choice,
and document your progress on your way there.

# Schumann - Estrella
## v3.1
### Initial Thoughts
What this first round of engraving issues will address is the finicky default behavior of the articulations and setting them manually. It will also address the final bar's idiosyncrasies. Finally, I hope to address the overall look of the score, adjusting furthermore the margins and page margins to better fit the spacing of the original.

### Process
To address the final bar, Finale must create a partial measure (i.e. a measure of 2/4) and "display" a 3/4 time signature. This is done through the `time signature tool` and it addressed using the `>more options` menu.

Time Elapsed: 00:02:00

When it comes to layout, I wanted to change the margins of the previous edition. the title looked wierd, and I wanted to compress the music a bit (to better match the original plate). This is done with the `page layout` tool and a click-and-drag approach. Overall, this process was simple, and merely a matter of taste.

To address the finicky articulations, one must adjust the articulation definitions to reflect manual changes. This is done through `articulation tool` and option clicking the articulation in question. Unfortunately, this is a tedious process.

Time Elapsed: 00:10:00

### Concluding Thoughts
Though some work was tedious, I anticipate the next sub-version or two to include some very tedious work. Things that will need to be done will include the individual adjustment of slur curves and note-to-note spacing issues. Otherwise, this version is in the final stretch.

### Initial Thoughts
This will be the final version for the first round of peer review. It will include stem length adjustments and any other errors I might have missed before. After this will be a discussion and critique of the text I have come up with, and then another round of edits (if needbe).

### Process
If there are any note lengths which need to be changed, it will be done via the `special tools` palette. It is a simple tool to use, and you must be in the correct voice (which can be quickly changed at the bottom-left corner of the window) to adjust everything. I also adjusted the title text to better approximate the spacing of the original plate.

#### Thoughts during this process
I often think, "why did the engraver choose to make the stem "x" length?" I also have to make a judgement call for the score because of how the score is laid-out to begin with. Does the stem length suite the score *here and now*?

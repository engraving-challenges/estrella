# Schumann - Estrella
## v2.7
### Initial thoughts
I realized, after the last version, that there are several idiosyncrasies that appeared in the score before I pulled. The entire score has "in key accidentals" for the second voice. In order to resolve this, I have to manually `erase` them with the `erase tool` found in `simple entry mode`. This is also harder to do on a laptop with a mouse like mine (I'm using the track-pad).

Time Elapsed: 00:07:00

### Process

I will be adjusting major (but uncomplicated) issues such as placement of articulations, and placement of dynamics and tempo markers.

Everything is done through the selection tool, by eye. It can be adjusted by the mouse or by arrows on the keyboard.

Time Elapsed: 00:10:00

### Thoughts
Finale has gotten a little difficult to deal with, especially with erasing some of the idiosyncrasies. For instance, when I went to erase some of the cautionary flats, the tool didn't always engage, and it effectively removed other things! I was constantly having to re-group with a `ctrl+z` to start over, before I could actually remove the marking. In some instances, I had to retrace my steps twice as much, because upon removing a flat, or sharp, it would remark a second accidental. I would have to then re-erase that accidental or input another accidental in order to get what I had originally written back to its original place.

In addition, upon moving around major articulations, dynamics, and tempo markers, I am seeing that I will have to adjust global `staff-to-staff` distances again. I will also need to adjust the placement of slurs and ties.

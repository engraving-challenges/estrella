# Schumann - Estrella
## v2.9
### Initial Thoughts
The intention with this version is to fix any remaining idiosyncrasies and get the text set properly before moving on the object placement and tweaking. My thinking is to start a version number `3` for the next phase of tweaking - the final number before finishing with a "publication quality" specimine.

Things TODO:

 1. Adjust any remaining beaming issues
 2. Get text and dynamic objects into the proper position (as to not clash with other objects)
 3. Adjust layout as to better match the original score (so that the spacing is close to original without further modification.

### Process
The first thing I want to do is adjust the overal spacing of the staves and constriction of the staff systems. This is quite simple in Finale, and it is done through the `page layout` tool. One can simply turn on `view grids` and even `snap to grid` to simplify the visual constriction of the staves. Overall, this is a strong feature of Finale's WYSIWYG approach to engraving.

The next thing I did was fix any beaming direction or slur direction issues. This is also simple, with a quick touch of a button.

Time Elapsed: 00:01:00

> Finale's default behavior is to lock objects to a grid (which is mainly to support "accurate" playback and ensure better version control between parts and master scores) which is sometimes supremely annoying. For instance, when I adjust the placement of a dynamic or articulation, sometimes it refuses to stay where I've placed it, for the sake of "snapping to the grid."

The next thing for me to do was to adjust the `staff-to-staff` distances. This is also very simple and easy to achieve.

Time Elapsed: 00:30:00

### Final Thoughts

I am going to have to come back to get objects to stay where they are. The pdf might seem ill-progressed, and this is because the objects continued to lock to some arbitrary grid after I had manually placed them. 

All other changes were done mostly by hand and fine-tuned by arrow keys. At this point it is safe to assume that nothing I do with Finale is no longer default behavior.
